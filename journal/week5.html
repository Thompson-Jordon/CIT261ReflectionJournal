   <h1>Week 5</h1>
   <div><p>
      This week I worked on Local Storage and Javascript Objects. I found that
      local storage is much easier to use then I previously had thought. I
      started thinking about what kind of app to make at and I think one good
      idea is a maitenance scheduler for work. It would allow the user to
      schedule maintenence on a device on a periodic basis and allow the user to
      mark when the work had been done. If this works well I may expand it to 
      add all of the field automation devices. and see if I can make a way to 
      submit an issue somewhat like a IT helpdesk program.
