   <h1>Week 3</h1>
   <p>This week I worked on DOM and JavaScript Topics. While working through the
      DOM topic i learned that if you use ".childNodes" instead of ".children"
      it will make you click the button twice before ".removeChild" works. I
      submitted both topics for fluency evaluations.</p>
