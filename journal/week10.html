      <p>
        This week I started on building my app. I am getting data from a
        Superhero api and Im displaying it on the screen. I also worked on
        building a SPA app from scratch using
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/frontend-fun/js-vanilla-script-spa-1b29b43ea475"
          >this site</a
        >
        as a guide. So far I have a main page loading in all of the characters.
        I also have a profile page that shows an individual character.
