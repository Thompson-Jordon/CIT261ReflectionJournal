   <h1>Week 13</h1>
   <div class="section">
      <p>This week I worked on finishing my mobile web app. I ran into a couple
         problems one of which was not being able to run any functions. After
         much troubleshooting I learned that it was because I can't trigger an 
         event on an html page when I'm using module type scripts. The only way 
         to get around this was to set an event listener in the js file. Once I
         figured that out I ran into another problem. My main page didn't contain
         my add favorites button. Since I set up my app as an SPA and my event
         listener would only be created if the button existed on load it wasn't 
         creating my event listener and my function was not being called. To fix
         this I set up a function to check if the button exsisted on a hash
         change. This allowed the event listener to be created and the function
         to be called.
