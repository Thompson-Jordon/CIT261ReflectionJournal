    <h1>Week 8</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        This week I finished and presented CSS with JavaScript, HTML5 Media
        tags, and JavaScript events. I also started looking into what it would
        take to make a JavaScript app from scratch. I found a very helpful
        tutorial by
        <a
          href="https://dev.to/rishavs/making-a-single-page-app-in-ye-good-olde-js-es6-3eng"
          >Rishav Sharan</a
        > He goes into depth on how to set up the routing and how to populate the
        content with the desired page. I started stubbing out an application but
        I have not yet settled on what I want to do for an app.
