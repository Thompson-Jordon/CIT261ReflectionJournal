    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This week I worked on JSON, AJAX, and JavaScript objects. I was able to
        present both the JSON, and AJAX pages in my group meeting this week and
        I Submitted a Fluency evaluation for both. I will try to present
        JavaScript Objects this next week. One really cool thing I learned about
        JavaScript this week is that you can create classes! This alone is
        amazing but you are also able to put your classes in seperate files
        allowing you to keep your code clean. <br />Here is a link that tells
        you more about it:
